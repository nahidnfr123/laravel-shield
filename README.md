# Guardian Package

**Guardian** is the zero-config API boilerplate for Laravel 12. It ships with Sanctum authentication, role/ability management, ready-made routes, seeders, factories, middleware logging, and an extensible configuration layer so any Laravel app can install the same battle-tested API surface in minutes.

## Why Guardian?

Guardian is everything you need to stand up a secure Laravel API without writing boilerplate:

-   **Production-ready surface in minutes.** Install once and immediately inherit login, registration, profile, role, privilege, and audit endpoints with sensible defaults.
-   **Security hardening out of the box.** Sanctum tokens automatically mirror role + privilege slugs, suspension workflows revoke tokens instantly, and the same middleware stack that protects the flagship Guardian app ships in this package.
-   **Roles, privileges, and Gate integration.** Manage reusable privileges per role via HTTP or CLI, then reuse them in middleware or `$user->can()` calls.
-   **Useful artisan command collection.** 40+ `guardian:*` commands let you seed roles, attach privileges, rotate tokens, suspend users, inspect Postman collections, and even prepare your User model, so incident response and onboarding never require raw SQL.
-   **Extensibility without friction.** Publish config, migrations, factories, or disable route auto-loading entirely when you want to override Guardian internals.
-   **Documentation and tooling baked in.** Comes with factories, seeders, tests, and an official Postman collection so teams can experiment or automate immediately.

## Requirements

-   PHP ^8.2
-   Laravel ^12.0
-   Laravel Sanctum ^4.0

## Quick start (TL;DR)

1. `composer require hasinhayder/guardian`
2. `php artisan guardian:install` (wraps `install:api` + `migrate` + `seed` + `prepare-user-model` so Sanctum, User model and your database are ready)

The rest of this document elaborates on those six steps and shows how to customize Guardian for your team.

## Step-by-step installation

### 1. Install the package

```bash
composer require hasinhayder/guardian
```

Guardian's service provider is auto-discovered. Publish its assets if you want to customize them:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=guardian-config
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=guardian-migrations
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=guardian-database
php artisan guardian:publish-config --force
php artisan guardian:publish-migrations --force
```

Need the ready-made API client collection? Run `php artisan guardian:postman-collection --no-open` to print the GitHub URL for the official Postman collection, or omit `--no-open` to open it directly.

### 2. Run `guardian:install` (recommended)

```bash
php artisan guardian:install
```

`guardian:install` is the one command you need to bootstrap Guardian on a fresh project. Under the hood it:

1. Calls Laravel 12's `install:api` so Sanctum's config, migration, and middleware stack are registered.
2. Runs `php artisan migrate` (respecting `--force` when you provide it) to apply both Laravel's and Guardian's database tables.
3. Prompts to execute `guardian:seed --force`, inserting the default role/privilege catalog plus the bootstrap admin account.
4. Offers to run `guardian:prepare-user-model` immediately if you skip seeding so the correct traits and imports land on your user model.

Skipping `guardian:install` means you must run each of those commands manually (`install:api`, `migrate`, `guardian:seed`, `guardian:prepare-user-model`). Most teams never need to—`guardian:install` keeps the happy path automated and idempotent.

### 3. Run Guardian's migrations & seeders manually (optional)

```bash
php artisan migrate
# or, interactively
php artisan guardian:seed
```

> ℹ️ Seeding is technically optional, but highly recommended the first time you install Guardian. `GuardianSeeder` inserts the default role catalogue (Administrator, User, Customer, Editor, All, Super Admin) and creates a ready-to-use `admin@guardian.project` superuser (password `guardian`). Skipping the seeder means you'll need to create equivalent roles and an admin account manually before any ability-gated routes will authorize.

### 4. Prepare your user model

Guardian augments whatever model you mark as `guardian.models.user` (defaults to `App\Models\User`). Make sure it can issue Sanctum tokens and manage Guardian roles:

```bash
php artisan guardian:prepare-user-model
```

The command above injects the required imports and trait usage automatically. Prefer editing manually? Here is what the class should look like:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Laravel\Sanctum\HasApiTokens;
use HasinHayder\Guardian\Concerns\HasGuardianRoles;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasApiTokens, HasGuardianRoles;
}
```

That is the only code change you need. Guardian will automatically attach the default role (slug `user`) to future registrations.

## Seeding (optional but recommended)

Guardian's `GuardianSeeder` keeps every environment aligned by inserting the default roles, privileges, and bootstrap admin account. Trigger it manually or rerun it with `--force` any time you need to refresh local data:

```bash
php artisan guardian:seed --force
```

Running the seeder will:

-   Insert the Administrator, User, Customer, Editor, All, and Super Admin roles along with their mapped privileges.
-   Create the `admin@guardian.project` superuser (password `guardian`) so you always have a token-ready account.
-   Reapply protected role/privilege relationships, ensuring middleware strings such as `ability:admin,super-admin` always resolve.

Need something narrower? Use `guardian:seed-roles` or `guardian:seed-privileges` to refresh a single catalog without touching users. Seeding remains optional, but skipping it means you must handcraft equivalent roles, privileges, and an administrator before ability-gated routes will authorize.

#### HasGuardianRoles API cheat sheet

The trait layered onto your `User` model brings a single source of truth for roles, privileges, and suspensions. Every helper below wraps logic used by Guardian's routes and artisan commands, so you can rely on them inside your own code without duplicating behavior.

| Method                                   | Category   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `roles(): BelongsToMany`                 | Roles      | Returns the eager-loadable relationship Guardian uses everywhere. Useful when you want to chain additional constraints.                                               |
| `assignRole(Role $role): void`           | Roles      | Syncs the provided role without detaching existing ones (Guardian uses this when seeding or attaching via CLI).                                                       |
| `removeRole(Role $role): void`           | Roles      | Detaches the given role from the pivot table.                                                                                                                     |
| `hasRole(string $role): bool`            | Roles      | Checks whether the user currently owns the provided role slug (honours wildcard `*`).                                                                             |
| `hasRoles(array $roles): bool`           | Roles      | Returns `true` only when the user holds every role in the provided array.                                                                                         |
| `privileges(): Collection`               | Privileges | Returns the unique collection of privileges inherited through the user's roles (pre-guardianted when `roles` is already loaded).                                      |
| `hasPrivileges(array $privileges): bool` | Privileges | Ensures the user inherits _all_ of the provided privilege slugs directly from their roles (no Sanctum token refresh needed).                                      |
| `can($ability, $arguments = []): bool`   | Privileges | Overrides Laravel's `Authorizable` hook so Guardian privilege slugs are treated just like Gate abilities. Falls back to `Gate::check()` for everything else.          |
| `suspend(?string $reason = null): void`  | Suspension | Sets `suspended_at`, stores an optional reason, saves the model, and revokes every Sanctum token via `$this->tokens()->delete()`. Mirrors the CLI/HTTP workflows. |
| `unsuspend(): void`                      | Suspension | Clears `suspended_at` and `suspension_reason` without touching roles or privileges.                                                                               |
| `isSuspended(): bool`                    | Suspension | Returns `true` when the model currently has a suspension timestamp. Guardian's guards and middleware rely on this helper.                                             |
| `getSuspensionReason(): ?string`         | Suspension | Convenience accessor to display the stored reason (or `null`).                                                                                                    |

> Note: `hasPrivilege()` is kept protected because it powers `can()`. Reach for `hasRole()`/`hasRoles()` or `hasPrivileges()` when you need explicit checks, and prefer `can()` or the `privilege`/`privileges` middleware for single privilege lookups.

Guardian caches role and privilege slugs per user so the authorization middleware never has to hit the database on every request. The cache is opt-out via `guardian.cache.enabled`, respects the store/TTL settings above, and is automatically invalidated whenever you mutate roles, privileges, or user-role assignments through Guardian's APIs or artisan commands.

Reach for these helpers anywhere—jobs, controllers, observers, Livewire components—to keep business logic consistent with Guardian's built-in routes and artisan commands.

### 5. Optional configuration

Override defaults in `config/guardian.php` to align with your app:

| Option                                   | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `version`                                | Value returned by `/api/guardian/version`.                                                                        |
| `disable_commands`                       | When `true` (or `GUARDIAN_DISABLE_COMMANDS=true`) Guardian skips registering its artisan commands.                    |
| `guard`                                  | Guard middleware used for protected routes (default `sanctum`).                                               |
| `route_prefix`                           | Route prefix (default `api`).                                                                                 |
| `disable_api`                            | When `true` (or `GUARDIAN_DISABLE_API=true`) Guardian skips loading its built-in routes.                          |
| `route_middleware`                       | Global middleware stack for package routes.                                                                   |
| `models.user`                            | Fully qualified class name of your user model.                                                                |
| `models.privilege`                       | Fully qualified class name of the privilege model (defaults to Guardian\Models\Privilege).                        |
| `tables.roles/pivot`                     | Override the role table (default `roles`) or user-role pivot (default `user_roles`).                          |
| `tables.users`                           | Table name Guardian targets when publishing its suspension columns (default `users`).                             |
| `tables.privileges/role_privilege`       | Override the privilege table (default `privileges`) or the role-privilege pivot (default `privilege_role`).   |
| `default_user_role_slug`                 | Role attached to new users (`user` by default).                                                               |
| `protected_role_slugs`                   | Role slugs that cannot be mutated or deleted.                                                                 |
| `delete_previous_access_tokens_on_login` | Enforce single-session logins when `true`.                                                                    |
| `cache.enabled`                          | Toggle Guardian's per-user role/privilege cache (enabled by default).                                             |
| `cache.store`                            | Choose which cache store to use for the helper cache (`null` falls back to Laravel's default store).          |
| `cache.ttl`                              | Seconds to cache role/privilege slugs. `null` (or `<= 0`) caches indefinitely until Guardian invalidates entries. |
| `abilities.*`                            | Ability arrays checked by the middleware groups.                                                              |

Set `load_default_routes` to `false` if you prefer to include `routes/api.php` manually and merge Guardian endpoints into your own files.

### Disable Guardian commands or API via `.env`

Guardian registers a sizable CLI toolbox. If you would rather keep production shells lean (or limit what teammates can run), drop the following snippet into `.env` on the environments you wish to lock down:

```
GUARDIAN_DISABLE_COMMANDS=true
```

With the variable set to `true`, Guardian skips registering every `guardian:*` artisan command while continuing to expose routes, middleware, and config overrides as usual. Remove the line (or set it to `false`) locally to regain the commands for development.

Need to turn off the bundled API endpoints entirely? Set:

```
GUARDIAN_DISABLE_API=true
```

When `GUARDIAN_DISABLE_API` is `true`, Guardian skips loading its `routes/api.php` file so you can provide a fully custom HTTP surface (or disable it in worker contexts).

Need an emergency token rotation? Run `php artisan guardian:logout-all-users --force` to revoke every Sanctum token the package has issued.

## Routes & middleware

Guardian registers the following API endpoints (prefixed by `guardian.route_prefix`, `api` by default):

-   `GET /guardian`, `GET /guardian/version`
-   `POST /login`
-   `POST /users` (public registration)
-   Authenticated routes (`auth:<guard>`):
    -   `GET /me`
    -   `PUT|PATCH|POST /users/{user}` (self + admin abilities)
    -   Admin-only group (`ability:admin,super-admin`): user CRUD, role CRUD, privilege CRUD, user-role assignments, role-privilege assignments

Wrap any route with the `guardian.log` middleware to capture request/response diagnostics inside `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

### Fine-grained protections for your own routes

Guardian exposes the exact middleware aliases it relies on (`ability`, `abilities`, `privilege`, `privileges`, `role`, `roles`, `guardian.log`, plus whichever `auth` guard you configure), so locking down your own endpoints feels identical to the built-in API.

#### Quick reference

| Middleware              | When to use it                                                                                       | Example                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `auth:guardian.guard`       | Ensures the request is authenticated via Sanctum (default) or your custom guard.                     | `auth:'.config('guardian.guard', 'sanctum')`   |
| `ability:comma,list`    | Require _all_ listed abilities (role slugs and/or privilege slugs).                                  | `'ability:admin,editor,reports.run'`       |
| `abilities:comma,list`  | Allow access when the token has _any_ of the listed abilities.                                       | `'abilities:billing.view,finance.approve'` |
| `role:comma,list`       | Require _all_ listed roles on the authenticated user (honours wildcard `*`).                         | `'role:admin,super-admin'`                 |
| `roles:comma,list`      | Allow access when the user holds _any_ of the listed roles (no token re-issue required).             | `'roles:editor,admin'`                     |
| `privilege:comma,list`  | Require _all_ listed privileges directly against the authenticated user (no need to reissue tokens). | `'privilege:reports.run,export.generate'`  |
| `privileges:comma,list` | Allow access when the user has _any_ of the listed privileges, checked in real time.                 | `'privileges:billing.view,reports.run'`    |
| `guardian.log`              | Log request/response pairs for auditing privileged routes.                                           | `'guardian.log'`                               |

Guardian assigns abilities to Sanctum tokens automatically—every role slug and privilege slug the user inherits becomes an ability on the token. That means you can freely mix role names and privilege identifiers inside the middleware strings. Need to bypass token abilities entirely? Reach for `role`/`roles`, which read directly from the authenticated user's role relationship on each request.

#### Step-by-step recipe

1. **Model the privilege**

    - CLI: `php artisan guardian:add-privilege reports.run --name="Run Reports"`
    - Attach it to a role: `php artisan guardian:attach-privilege reports.run editor`
    - HTTP alternative: `POST /api/privileges` then `POST /api/roles/{role}/privileges`

2. **(Optional) Group abilities in config**
   Publish `config/guardian.php` and add helper buckets so you do not repeat strings:

    ```php
    'abilities' => [
        'reports.generate' => ['admin', 'reports.run'],
        'billing.manage' => ['super-admin', 'billing.view'],
    ],
    ```

3. **Guard the route**
   Pick the guard (defaults to `sanctum`) and chain ability middleware:

    ```php
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

    Route::middleware([
        'auth:'.config('guardian.guard', 'sanctum'),
        'ability:'.implode(',', config('guardian.abilities.reports.generate')),
        'guardian.log',
    ])->post('reports/run', ReportsController::class);

    // OR inline without config helpers
    Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'abilities:reports.run,admin'])
        ->delete('reports/{report}', [ReportsController::class, 'destroy']);
    ```

4. **Enforce inside controllers & policies**
   The `HasGuardianRoles` trait brings helpers you can fall back to even without middleware:

    ```php
    if (! $request->user()->can('reports.run')) {
    	abort(403, 'Missing reports privilege.');
    }

    if ($request->user()->hasRole('admin') || $request->user()->hasRole('editor')) {
    	// Show extra UI affordances
    }
    ```

5. **Audit sensitive flows**
   Chain `guardian.log` when you want Laravel's log to record payloads and responses for forensic review:

    ```php
    Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'ability:billing.view', 'guardian.log'])
        ->get('billing/statements', BillingStatementController::class);
    ```

Guardian's service provider registers every middleware alias above the moment you install the package—no manual kernel edits required.

#### Worked examples

**Protect an export endpoint with multiple roles**

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'abilities:admin,super-admin,reports.run'])
	->post('exports/run', FileExportController::class);
```

Any token containing _either_ the `admin` role slug, the `super-admin` role slug, or the `reports.run` privilege gets through. Everyone else receives 403.

**Role-only guard without touching token abilities**

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'role:admin,super-admin'])
	->get('admin/dashboard', AdminDashboardController::class);

Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', 'roles:editor,admin'])
	->post('articles/publish', PublishArticleController::class);
```

The first route requires both `admin` and `super-admin` slugs on the authenticated user, while the second lets either `editor` or `admin` through—perfect when your guard does not mint custom Sanctum abilities.

**Scoped settings route that reuses Guardian's presets**

```php
Route::middleware([
	'auth:sanctum',
	'ability:'.implode(',', config('guardian.abilities.user_update')),
])->patch('settings/profile', ProfileController::class);
```

`config('guardian.abilities.user_update')` already includes the roles you seeded, so the route stays tight even if you change which roles may update profiles later.

**Policy-level checks**

```php
public function destroy(User $user, Report $report): bool
{
	return $user->hasRole('admin') || $user->can('reports.run');
}
```

This keeps controllers tidy when you prefer authorisation logic in policies.

> 💡 Tip: use `guardian:roles-with-privileges` to double-check that the roles you expect include the privilege slugs referenced in middleware. Pair it with `guardian:user-privileges {user}` to see the exact privilege table resolved by `HasGuardianRoles::privileges()`, and fall back to `guardian:me` when you need to inspect the bearer token's abilities.

### Privilege management (admin-only)

```bash
# List privileges and the roles that inherit them
curl http://localhost/api/privileges -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"

# Create a new privilege
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/privileges \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
	-d '{"name":"Run Reports","slug":"reports.run"}'

# Attach privilege ID 2 to the Editor role (ID 4)
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/roles/4/privileges \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
	-d '{"privilege_id":2}'

# Detach again
curl -X DELETE http://localhost/api/roles/4/privileges/2 \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

### Privilege-driven authorization

Guardian introduces first-class privileges that belong to roles. Each privilege is a reusable capability such as `report.generate` or `billing.view`. Roles now own any number of privileges, and the `HasGuardianRoles` trait exposes a Laravel-style `can()` helper so you can evaluate privileges anywhere:

```php
if ($request->user()->can('report.generate')) {
	// build the export – the user inherited the privilege through any of their roles
}
```

Guardian keeps everything synced through three layers:

-   **HTTP API** – `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /api/privileges` plus `POST|DELETE /api/roles/{role}/privileges/{privilege}` let you manage privileges remotely.
-   **Artisan commands** – run `guardian:privileges`, `guardian:add-privilege`, `guardian:attach-privilege`, etc. to script migrations or incident response from the CLI.
-   **Database seeders** – the default `GuardianSeeder` now inserts sample privileges (reports, billing, wildcard) so fresh installs have meaningful data on day one.

Tokens automatically inherit abilities for every privilege on the user's roles, so no additional middleware changes are required.

### User suspension

Guardian now ships with first-class user suspension support so you can freeze accounts without deleting them:

-   Publish the latest migrations (`php artisan guardian:publish-migrations --force`) to add the `suspended_at` and `suspension_reason` columns to your user table.
-   Suspend an account with `php artisan guardian:suspend-user --user=5 --reason="Manual review"` (accepts ID or email). Rerun the command with `--unsuspend` to lift the hold.
-   Prefer `php artisan guardian:unsuspend-user --user=5` (or the `--unsuspend` flag above) when you want a dedicated command that clears the columns and confirms intent.
-   Need an HTTP workflow instead? `POST /api/users/{id}/suspend` (admin tokens only) applies the lock and accepts an optional `reason` string, while `DELETE /api/users/{id}/suspend` lifts it—both endpoints mirror the CLI behavior and revoke tokens on suspension.
-   Inspect every frozen account (and its reason) via `php artisan guardian:suspended-users` or spot them inline with `php artisan guardian:users`—suspended names render in red/orange and the table exposes a dedicated `Suspended` column.
-   Authentication guardrails are automatic: `/api/login` returns `user is suspended` (HTTP 423) for suspended accounts, while `guardian:login` refuses to mint tokens and prints the stored reason so operators know why an account is locked.
-   CLI automation also respects suspensions: `guardian:quick-token` fails fast with the stored reason so CI/CD jobs never mint tokens for frozen accounts.
-   The moment you suspend an account every Sanctum token it previously held is revoked—`guardian:suspend-user` deletes them and prints a warning so operators know active sessions were terminated.

This workflow keeps your audit trail intact while preventing access across both HTTP and CLI surfaces.

## Using Guardian (practical examples)

Guardian is opinionated but not limiting—the following snippets mirror the workflows we verified in the sandbox project.

### Artisan helpers

Guardian now ships with a `guardian:*` CLI toolbox so you can manage roles, users, and tokens without crafting SQL by hand:

| Command                                                                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                 |

Every command accepts non-interactive `--option` flags, making them automation-friendly and easy to exercise inside CI or artisan tests.

### Public auth flow

```bash
# Register a user
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/users \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"name":"Jane User","email":"jane@example.com","password":"password","password_confirmation":"password"}'

# Login (admin or regular user)
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/login \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-d '{"email":"admin@guardian.project","password":"guardian"}'
```

The login response contains a Sanctum token with the correct abilities already embedded based on the user's roles.

### Authenticated requests

```bash
TOKEN="<paste token here>"

# Who am I?
curl http://localhost/api/me \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"

# Update my profile (requires ability list in `guardian.abilities.user_update`)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost/api/users/1 \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
	-d '{"name":"Guardian Admin"}'
```

### Role management (admin-only)

```bash
# List roles
curl http://localhost/api/roles -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"

# Attach the "Editor" role to user 5
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/users/5/roles \
	-H "Accept: application/json" \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
	-d '{"role_id":4}'

# Remove that role again
curl -X DELETE http://localhost/api/users/5/roles/4 \
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
```

### Consuming Guardian inside Laravel code

Guardian is just another set of routes, so you can call them through Laravel's HTTP client if you want server-to-server automation:

```php
$token = Http::post('https://api.example.com/api/login', [
		'email' => 'admin@guardian.project',
		'password' => 'guardian',
])->json('token');

$roles = Http::withToken($token)->get('https://api.example.com/api/roles')->json();

Http::withToken($token)->post('https://api.example.com/api/users/5/roles', [
		'role_id' => 2,
]);
```

	}
}
```

### How do I get the authenticated user's privileges?

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ApiTokenController
{
	public function show(Request $request)
	{
		$privileges = $request->user()->guardianPrivilegeSlugs();

		return response()->json(['privileges' => $privileges]);
	}
}
```

### How do I assign or remove roles to a user from code?

```php
use HasinHayder\Guardian\Models\Role;
use App\Models\User;

class UserRoleController
{
	public function assignRoles()
	{
		$user = User::find(1);

		// Assign a single role
		$editorRole = Role::where('slug', 'editor')->first();
		$user->assignRole($editorRole);

		// Assign multiple roles
		$adminRole = Role::where('slug', 'admin')->first();
		$user->assignRole($adminRole);

		// Or use the roles relationship directly
		$customerRole = Role::where('slug', 'customer')->first();
		$user->roles()->attach($customerRole->id);
	}

	public function removeRoles()
	{
		$user = User::find(1);

		// Remove a single role
		$editorRole = Role::where('slug', 'editor')->first();
		$user->removeRole($editorRole);

		// Or use the roles relationship directly
		$user->roles()->detach($editorRole->id);

		// Remove all roles
		$user->roles()->detach();
	}
}
```

### How do I assign or remove privileges to a role?

```php
use HasinHayder\Guardian\Models\Role;
use HasinHayder\Guardian\Models\Privilege;

class RolePrivilegeController
{
	public function assignPrivileges()
	{
		$role = Role::where('slug', 'editor')->first();

		// Assign a single privilege
		$reportPrivilege = Privilege::where('slug', 'reports.run')->first();
		$role->privileges()->attach($reportPrivilege->id);

		// Assign multiple privileges at once
		$billingPrivilege = Privilege::where('slug', 'billing.view')->first();
		$exportPrivilege = Privilege::where('slug', 'reports.export')->first();
		$role->privileges()->attach([
			$billingPrivilege->id,
			$exportPrivilege->id,
		]);

		// Or sync privileges (replaces all existing privileges)
		$role->privileges()->sync([
			$reportPrivilege->id,
			$billingPrivilege->id,
		]);
	}

	public function removePrivileges()
	{
		$role = Role::where('slug', 'editor')->first();

		// Remove a single privilege
		$reportPrivilege = Privilege::where('slug', 'reports.run')->first();
		$role->privileges()->detach($reportPrivilege->id);

		// Remove multiple privileges
		$role->privileges()->detach([
			$reportPrivilege->id,
			$billingPrivilege->id,
		]);

		// Remove all privileges from the role
		$role->privileges()->detach();
	}
}
```

### How do I get the list of privileges in a role?

```php
use HasinHayder\Guardian\Models\Role;

class RolePrivilegesController
{
	public function show(Role $role)
	{
		// Load privileges relationship
		$role->loadMissing('privileges:id,name,slug');

		return response()->json([
			'role' => $role->only(['id', 'name', 'slug']),
			'privileges' => $role->privileges,
		]);
	}

	public function getPrivilegeSlugs(Role $role)

		// Get only the privilege slugs as an array
		$privilegeSlugs = $role->privileges()->pluck('slug')->toArray();

		return response()->json(['privilege_slugs' => $privilegeSlugs]);
	}
}
```

### How do I check if a role has specific privileges?

The `Role` model includes `hasPrivilege()` and `hasPrivileges()` methods for checking privileges:

```php
use HasinHayder\Guardian\Models\Role;

class RoleCheckController
{
	public function checkPrivileges()
	{
		$role = Role::where('slug', 'editor')->first();

		// Check if role has a single privilege
		if ($role->hasPrivilege('reports.run')) {
			// Role has the reports.run privilege
		}

		// Check if role has ALL specified privileges
		if ($role->hasPrivileges(['reports.run', 'billing.view'])) {
			// Role has both reports.run AND billing.view privileges
		}

		// Check if role has ANY of the specified privileges
		$hasAny = $role->privileges()
			->whereIn('slug', ['reports.run', 'billing.view'])
			->exists();
	}
}
```

### How do I check if the authenticated user has particular roles?

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ArticleController
{
	public function store(Request $request)
	{
		if (! $request->user()->hasRoles(['editor', 'admin'])) {
			abort(403, 'Editors or admins only.');
		}

		// Create the article
	}

	public function destroy(Request $request)
	{
		if (! $request->user()->hasRole('super-admin')) {
			abort(403, 'Super admins only.');
		}

		// Delete the article
	}
}
```

### How do I check if the authenticated user has specific privileges?

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class BillingReportController

		if (! $request->user()->hasPrivileges(['reports.run', 'billing.view'])) {
			abort(403, 'Missing reporting privileges.');
		}

		// Build the report
	}

	public function export(Request $request)
	{
		if (! $request->user()->can('reports.export')) {
			abort(403, 'Missing export privilege.');
		}

		// Return the file download
	}
}
```

### How do I check if a user is suspended and inspect the reason?

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class LoginStatusController
{
	public function __invoke(Request $request)
	{

## Database assets

-   `database/migrations/*` creates the `roles`, `user_roles`, `privileges`, and `privilege_role` tables (configurable via `config/guardian.php`).
-   `database/seeders/GuardianSeeder` seeds the core roles, default privileges, and creates the admin bootstrap user.
-   `database/factories/UserFactory` targets whichever user model you configure, and `PrivilegeFactory` speeds up testing custom privileges.

## Development

-   `src/Providers/GuardianServiceProvider.php` handles route loading, publishing, and middleware aliases.
-   Controllers live under `src/Http/Controllers/*` and operate against the configurable user model.
-   `routes/api.php` declares all endpoints and ability middleware in one place.
